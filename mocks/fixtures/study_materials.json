    "content": "Q: What is a chemical reaction?\nA: A process where substances interact to form new compounds with different properties.\n\nQ: Name the four types of chemical reactions.\nA: Combination, decomposition, displacement, and double displacement.\n\nQ: What is a combination reaction?\nA: A reaction where two or more substances combine to form a single product.\n\nQ: Give an example of decomposition.\nA: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂\n\nQ: What happens in displacement reactions?\nA: A more reactive element displaces a less reactive one from its compound.\n\nQ: What is double displacement?\nA: Two compounds exchange their ions to form two new compounds.\n\nQ: What role do catalysts play?\nA: They speed up chemical reactions without being consumed.\n\nQ: How do we represent chemical reactions?\nA: Using chemical equations with reactants on the left and products on the right.",
